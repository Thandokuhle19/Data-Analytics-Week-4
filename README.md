# Data Governance Concepts
- Data governance is essential for organizations to safeguard their information and make it useful for day-to-day operations and analysis.
- Similar to how governments create and enforce laws, organizations establish policies and procedures to manage their data effectively.
- These governance policies cover data quality, attribute usage, access control, security, compliance, privacy protection, and data retention.
- Executive support is crucial for the success of data governance initiatives, as it requires a significant investment of time and resources.
- While technology plays a vital role in enforcing data governance policies, it is not solely responsible for its success.
- All levels of the organization must understand the importance of well-governed data to ensure compliance with regulations and protection of information.
- Ultimately, strong leadership and support from executives across the organization are key to driving effective data governance efforts.

_Data Governannce Roles:_
- Data governance relies on the collaboration of multiple individuals fulfilling various roles, with data stewardship being a key concept.
- Data stewardship involves developing the policies and procedures to ensure the quality, security, privacy, and regulatory compliance of an organization's data.
- The organizational data steward plays a crucial role in leading data governance activities and acts as the link between technical and non-technical divisions within the organization.
- Data owners, senior business leaders responsible for specific data domains, work closely with data stewards to establish governance policies.
- In complex organizations, data owners may delegate governance activities to subject area data stewards who work within specific operational divisions.
- Subject area data stewards handle daily tasks on behalf of data owners, such as processing access requests.
- Data custodians are responsible for implementing technical controls that enforce data governance policies, typically IT employees who configure applications and databases.
- Access requirements for data are crucial in determining who needs access to specific data, which can vary depending on the data subject area.
- For example, managers may need access to employee performance data but not their Social Security numbers to prevent identity theft.
- Overall, effective data governance relies on the collaboration and coordination of organizational data stewards, data owners, subject area data stewards, and data custodians to ensure the proper stewardship of an organization's data.
- By understanding and implementing data governance policies, these roles work together to maintain data quality, security, and regulatory compliance within the organization.
- To determine access requirements, a data classification matrix is crucial.
- This matrix outlines categories, descriptions, and disclosure implications for data.
- Data stewardship involves collaborating with various roles to establish classifications, develop access procedures, and implement technical controls to safeguard information.
- Consideration of data classification is imperative for proper data management and protection.

_Access Permissions:_
- Role-based access is a best practice for managing data permissions, as it simplifies permissions management by assigning access based on the roles individuals hold within an organization.
- This approach is illustrated through an example of an employee named Ralph who changes roles within the company over time.
- When Ralph switches from Finance to Facilities to Human Resources, his access permissions are adjusted accordingly by a data custodian to reflect his new role and the data he needs to perform his duties.
- Using role-based access not only streamlines permissions maintenance and improves consistency but also ensures that individuals only have access to the data necessary for their current roles.
- In contrast, user-based access, which assigns permissions directly to individuals, is a risky practice that can lead to operational complexity and potential mistakes.
- By implementing role-based access, organizations can effectively manage permissions while also facilitating compliance auditing.
